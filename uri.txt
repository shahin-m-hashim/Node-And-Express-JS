The MongoDB connection string, also known as the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), is used to 
connect to a MongoDB database server. It encapsulates all the information needed to connect to 
the database, including the server address, authentication details, and other connection options. 

Here's what you need to know about creating and modifying the URI in an easy-to-understand manner:

Standard Connection String Format: 

This is the typical format used to connect to a MongoDB deployment, such as a standalone server, 
a replica set, or a sharded cluster. 

It follows the pattern mongodb://username:password@host:port/database, 

where each part has a specific meaning:

mongodb:// indicates the protocol for connecting to MongoDB.
username:password@ are optional credentials for authentication.
host:port specifies the server address and port number.
/database is the name of the database to connect to.

SRV Format: 

The SRV (Service) format is primarily used for connecting to MongoDB Atlas clusters and allows 
for more flexible configuration. It follows the pattern -

mongodb+srv://username:password@hostname/database.

The +srv indicates that the DNS SRV record should be used to determine the hostname(s) to connect to.

Connecting to a Specific Database: 

In the connection string, you can specify the database to which you want to connect. 
This is indicated by /database at the end of the URI.

Here's a simple example of a connection string:

mongodb://user:password@host:27017/db

In this example:
user and password are the authentication credentials.
the host is the server address.
27017 is the port number.
db is the name of the database to connect to.

You can modify the connection string to match your MongoDB deployment and user authentication credentials. 
Once you have the connection string ready, you can use it in your MERN stack application to connect 
to the MongoDB database using a library like Mongoose.
