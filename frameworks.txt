A Framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of our project.
it cannot be seamlessly integrated into an existing project. Instead, it can be used
to provide the boilerplate/template to build a new project.
The framework is in control of the code and we have to follow the rules of the framework.
The framework calls the code that we write. 
Framework contains a collection of libraries.

Eg: Angular JS is a framework that we can use to build user interfaces. It contains reusable functions
and components that we can use in our code. But it also dictates the architecture of our project.
