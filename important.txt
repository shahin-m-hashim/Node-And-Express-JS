Using API testing tools like Postman or Insomnia to test and validate the handling of request responses 
by the backend server before integrating them into the front end is considered a best practice in software 
development. Here's why:

Isolation of Frontend and Backend Development: By using these tools, the frontend and backend development 
can progress independently. The backend developers can create and test the APIs using these tools without
needing the front end to be ready. This allows for parallel development and reduces dependencies between 
frontend and backend teams.

Rapid Iteration and Debugging: API testing tools allow for quick iteration and debugging of API endpoints. 
Developers can easily modify requests and observe responses, ensuring that the backend behavior is as 
expected. This can significantly speed up the development process.

Security and Stability: Testing the backend APIs in isolation ensures that security measures, such as 
input validation and authentication, can be thoroughly tested before being exposed to the frontend. 
This can help identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process.

Documentation and Collaboration: These tools often allow for the creation and sharing of API documentation,
making it easier for frontend and backend developers to collaborate on API contracts and understand how 
to interact with the backend systems.

Automated Testing: API testing tools often support automated testing, which can be integrated into the 
CI/CD pipeline. This allows for continuous testing and validation of backend APIs, ensuring that changes 
to the backend don't inadvertently break frontend functionality.
