Node JS - 
Built on Chrome's V8 Engine which is a high-performance JavaScript engine.
Runtime environment to run JavaScript code outside the browser.
Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world.
Node.js is used by companies such as Walmart, Netflix, Uber, Paypal, etc.

Traditionally, JavaScript was mainly used for client-side scripting in web browsers. 
However, with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used on the server side as well. 
This means that we can write server-side applications, such as web servers, APIs, and 
command-line tools, using JavaScript.

One of the key features of Node.js is its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This means that Node.js 
can handle multiple requests simultaneously without getting blocked. It achieves this by using asynchronous 
programming, where tasks are executed in the background while other tasks continue to run. 
This makes Node.js highly efficient and scalable, allowing it to handle a large number of concurrent 
connections.

Another advantage of Node.js is its package ecosystem called npm. npm is the largest ecosystem of 
open-source libraries in the world. It provides a vast collection of reusable modules and packages 
that can be easily integrated into our Node.js applications. This allows developers to leverage existing 
solutions and accelerate the development process.

Node.js has gained popularity because of its performance, scalability, and the ability to use JavaScript 
both on the client side and server side. It has been adopted by many large companies, including Walmart, 
Netflix, Uber, and Paypal rely on Node.js to power their backend systems.


Differences between JavaScript in the browser and Node JS

Browser - 
1. DOM
2. Window
3. Interactive Apps
4. No Filesystem
5. Fragmentation
6. ES6 Modules

Node.js
1. NO DOM
2. No Window
3. Server-Side Apps
4. Filesystem
5. Versions
6. CommonJS


Running JavaScript in the system:
1. Open the terminal
2. Type node and it will start the node interactive shell
3. Type usual js codes and it will execute
4. Type .exit or ctrl+c twice to exit the node environment
5. To run a js file simply type node filename.js and it will execute the file
