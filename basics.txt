1. Connect to a cluster in your machine using uri using shell or compass or driver
    eg: mongodb://localhost:27017
    In shell, use mongosh "uri"
    Note:-  By default, using the URI above there are no authentication credentials required.  

authentication - the process of verifying the identity of a user who is trying to connect to a database.
authorization - 
    the process of verifying that the user has permission to perform the various operations.
    ie; assign roles to the user. 

To specify a username and password when connecting to a MongoDB database, you typically need 
to set up authentication and authorization manually.

1. Switch to the admin database using the use admin command.
    Use the db.createUser method to create a new user with a specific username and password, 
    along with the necessary roles and privileges. For example:

    db.createUser(
    {
        user: "myUserAdmin",
        pwd: "pwd",
        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
    }
    )

    make sure to enable authentication in mongod.cfg file in C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\bin
        security:
            authentication: enabled

2. Verify using db.auth() method - db.auth("myUserAdmin", "pwd")
3. To see the list of users in the database, use the db.getUsers() method -
4. To update the password of a user, use the db.changeUserPassword() method - 
    db.changeUserPassword("myUserAdmin", "newPwd")
5. To delete a user, use the db.dropUser() method - db.dropUser("myUserAdmin")
6. To delete all users, use the db.dropAllUsers() method - db.dropAllUsers()
7. To delete all users from all databases, use the db.dropAllUsersFromDatabase() method - 
        db.dropAllUsersFromDatabase()
8. To delete a database, use the db.dropDatabase() method - db.dropDatabase()
