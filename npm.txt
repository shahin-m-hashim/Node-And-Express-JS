NPM is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. 
Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

When we need to create something we have 2 options
1. create everything from scratch
2. use something that already exists 

For eg: suppose we need a slider for our website, either we can create it from scratch 
or we could simply use a package that already contains the code/js files to do so

NPM is a package manager that helps us to install packages and use them in our project.

A package is a collection of code or folders that someone else has written and published to the NPM registry.

A dependency is a package that our project depends on. it can be a package that we have installed directly 
or a package that is required by another package that we have installed. 

Dev dependencies are packages that are only needed during development.
