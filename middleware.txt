Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the 
Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.
