A library is a collection of pre-written code that can perform specific tasks without having to write
it ourselves from scratch. 

It's a set of reusable functions that we can use in our code.
You are in full control of the code and you can use as much or as little of it as you want.
You can call the libraries that provide the functions you need in your code anywhere you want.

For eg: React is a library that we can use to build user interfaces. It contains reusable functions
and components that we can use in our code.
